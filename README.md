# Download Files from Kaggle

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`download-from-kaggle.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to download output files from a Kaggle kernel directly into your working environment.

## Overview

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to:
1.  **Authenticate with the Kaggle API**: Securely set up your Kaggle credentials to interact with the API.
2.  **Download Kernel Outputs**: Use a simple command to fetch all output files from a specified public or private kernel.
3.  **Zip Directories**: An optional but useful utility function is included to compress downloaded folders (e.g., model checkpoints) into a single zip file for easier management and download.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `download-from-kaggle.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3.  Follow the instructions within the notebook:
    *   Add your Kaggle username and API key.
    *   Update the kernel slug to point to your desired Kaggle kernel.
    *   Run the cells sequentially to authenticate, download, and zip your files.

All the necessary code and commands are provided within the notebook itself.
